Amongst the hustle and bustle of the impatient crowd, there is one sikh who sits apart, in eternal patience.
The people are giving importance to getting into the temple, whereas this man gives importance to what the temple stands for.The man sits in deep meditation absorbing the scene and becoming one with it.
He watches Wahegurus hukam in action, intuitively enters a peaceful state and drinks the sweet Amrit of Wahegurus name.
He remains near the edge of the hukam as he sits at the edge of the pool and the steps.We know the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab as Hari Mandir, more commonly as Harmandir Sahib, however in Guru Granth Sahib, it is the body that is referred to as Hari Mandir.In Guru Granth Sahib, 1059, Guru Amar Das ji says The body is Hari Mandir, the temple of Hari.
He created it and dwells within it.
Through the Gurus words, those who connect to Hari within, are merged into him.
Guru Amardas Ji (Guru Granth Sahib, 1059)The body itself becomes Hari Mandir when Hari comes to reside.
And Hari fully comes to reside in the body only when the mind recognizes the Hukam taking place.
In this manner, the spiritually exalted man meditates on the edge between past and future, on that which is happening right now, the Hukam of Hari.You could say that in a way, this painting actually shows two Hari Mandir.
