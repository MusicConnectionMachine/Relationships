With that, some thoughts on some of the contracts handed out to recently departed and freshly minted Cardinals: Campbell got $30 million guaranteed over the first two years of his four-year deal, and gets a $3M bonus in early 2019 if the Jaguars choose to keep him.
Thats a lot of money, but its why the Cardinals-Campbell marriage was destined to end.
The Jags had (have) oodles of cap space, so they front-loaded the contract.
The Cards didnt see fiscally how that would make sense for them.
The same goes for the $19 million guaranteed for Tony Jefferson and the $8 million guaranteed for Marcus Cooper, who got a three-year deal with the Bears.
Bruce Arians said Cooper could get big money, and he did.
I have to say I was a little surprised.
Along those lines, Ive heard from a handful of fans asking me about doing something like a trade for Patriots RFA CB Malcolm Butler.
Not going to happen.
To give up a pick and be facing a need for a giant contract extension in a secondary that already has two giant contracts with Pat P and Honey Badger, nope.
This draft class is strong at cornerback.
Id guess they will draft one at some point.
Will they add a vet?
Maybe, but it wont be for giant money.
Karlos Dansby gets $2 million if he stays healthy and plays a lot.
Thats a reasonable contract for a soon-to-be 36-year-old who figures to start.
(Kevin Minter, who was unlikely to return after Dansby signed, was reportedly visiting the Colts Monday.) Jarvis Jones, the Steelers OLB free agent, was visiting the Cardinals.
That would seem tied to Alex Okafor, who was visiting the Saints.
If Okafor comes back to the Cardinals, they wont need Jones.
If Okafor departs, theres a need Jones could fill.
Have to say I was a little surprised Andre Ellington returned, not because the Cards wouldnt want him they need players behind David Johnson and Ellington can produce, especially as a receiver but because I thought hed want to find a place where he might get more time.
The running backs market is not robust.
And Ellington said he wanted to stay.
Speaking of prices, Im sure it was a team-friendly contract.
Itd be good to see Ellington break off a couple of those electrifying plays he had his first couple of years.

Arians said it will be a matter of pain tolerance more than functional strength.
WR John Smokey Brown has been cleared from concussion protocol and will return to the practice field.
Needs to get in shape, but hes finally back.
DT Robert Nkemdiche is close to coming back from his bad ankle.
Arians said he hopes hes out there Wednesday.
The Cards practice today and Monday and are off Tuesday.
The PUP guys S Tyrann Mathieu, CB Justin Bethel and DT Frostee Rucker are back doing individual drills today and are in uniform for the first time.
G Mike Iupati (knee) is not practicing.

Bruce Arians said that, his players did too.
But the end result didnt feel all that good.
The offense looked ugly, which really isnt what youd like to see at this point of camp (and things went pretty well in the first-units one series in the preseason opener, so its not like they were bad a week ago).
But then you throw in the news that best case scenario, linebacker Alex Okafor would have to play the season with a torn biceps tendon, and thats only if he decides not to have surgery.
Thats a tough call.
Okafor is going to be a free agent after the season.
If he waits on surgery, he wont be a full strength and hell have to have surgery right before signing with another team.
Surgery now, and hell have no season in which to entice teams to sign him.
He called it one of the most difficult decisions hes made (and he had to make the same exact decision already, with Arians, when he was a rookie in 2013.) Okafor suffered the injury in practice Tuesday night.
Well see what his choice is and what it means.
Okafor is/was the third linebacker to give relief to starters Chandler Jones and Markus Golden.
Interesting that Arians said Jaron Brown is the best receiver the Cardinals have right now.
Brown did make a pair of great grabs against the Chargers.
One of the few bright spots.
Larry Fitzgerald sat with a minor MCL sprain, Arians said.
It isnt serious.
Deone Bucannon hammered wide receiver Dontrelle Inman early in the game, a clean hit (a penalty wasnt called and the replays Ive seen show a hard hit to the upper chest) that knocked Inmans helmet off.
Inman was checked for a concussion and cleared, but did not return.
Im a physical player, Bucannon said.
Thats what it is and I like setting the tempo for the team and making plays within the rules of football.
I love playing the game with passion.
Couldnt tell exactly how D.J.
Humphries did at right tackle, but frankly, there wasnt anyone on offense (except maybe Jaron Brown) that will be able to be excited about how he played.
Cornerback Brandon Williams gave up a 13-yard pass early, but held up better in my opinion.
Overall, it seemed like a better performance.
Arians, in his postgame radio interview: You cant play the game without passion, energy or brains and we didnt have any of the three.
One more week of training camp to go.

Humphries, Deone Bucannon, Jaron Brown, Larry Fitzgerald Posted in | 33 Comments Freeneys visits and the roster wait Posted by on May 25, 2016 2:06 pm Would Dwight Freeney be brought back?
Until he signs elsewhere, I suppose thats possible.
But he just visited the Bengals and news came today hes going to visit the Falcons, and at some point, if he makes sense somewhere else, he may just come off the market.
In the meantime, its understandable that the Cardinals dont see a need to have him right now.
The trade for Chandler Jones obviously impacted the situation.
If Freeney who was originally signed because Alex Okafor got hurt, if you recall was the lead pass rusher, well, thats Jones job now.
Markus Golden likely is the other starter, and a healthy Okafor is back and apparently past whatever was left from his playoff disappearance.
Plus, the Cards want to see what they have in Tristan Okapalaugo, Shaq Riddick and Zack Wagenmann.
If we get to training camp and Freeney remains unsigned and the depth isnt looking quite like what the Cardinals wanted, Freeney would be a natural option.
This deep into the offseason, though, it feels like a long-term waiting game, if it were to happen at all.

When, exactly, remains an unknown, although Ian Rapoport reported Monday the team and Mathieu are deep in negotiations toward a deal.
Ive long felt this was a matter of when and not if with the all-pro safety.
For a multitude of reasons for both sides, it behooves both to get a new contract done.
But from the Cardinals end, a big reason to want to lock up Mathieu is because of the laundry list of players who, as of right now, are free agents after this upcoming season.
Its a subject weve talked about before, and the reality is not everyone will be with the Cardinals after this year.
Still, if you have hope to having some guys around, youd think the Cards would want to pare down the work facing them before this year ends.
Here is the list and it doesnt include every single FA-to-be of guys who are contract-less after 2016, as it stands right now: WR Larry Fitzgerald TE Jermaine Gresham That isnt the entire list, but those are the bigger names.
Obviously, each are taken individually to an extent.
Some guys the team will just move on from in the normal course of roster change in a salary-capped world.
But big picture, its a puzzle GM Steve Keim and his department are working on as this season approaches.

Swearinger, Evan Mathis, Frostee Rucker, Jaron Brown, Jermaine Gresham, Kevin Minter, Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, Stepfan Taylor, Tony Jefferson, Tyrann Mathieu Posted in | 36 Comments A pass rusher arrives as Coop leaves Posted by on March 15, 2016 2:55 pm Not even 24 hours had passed since the Cardinals had lost the NFC Championship, and Steve Keim made clear his offseason priority.
Create a pass rush, the Cardinals GM said.
Easier said than done.
There were a few pass rushers on the free agent market, although none were coming off eye-popping seasons.
That didnt stop the money from flowing, however, and the Cardinals tried to get into it, making a push for Jason Pierre-Paul that ultimately came up short.
It didnt look all that promising going forward, unless the Cardinals could grab someone with the 29th overall pick in the draft.
Free agency overall was quiet for the Cards.
And then suddenly, the news broke Tuesday.
A trade, and Keim had his pass rusher.
Chandler Jones, who made the Pro Bowl with his 12.5 sacks in New England, was coming to Arizona (pending physicals, of course) in exchange for guard Jonathan Cooper and the Cards second-round draft pick in April.
Its hard not to see this as a huge win for the Cards.
The reality was Cooper had never really developed into what the Cardinals wanted, and flipping a second-round pick for a proven pass rusher was simply a good move.
This trade wont be evaluated fully for a while, but on the day it happened, it is a Keim win.
Jones is going into the last year of his contract (making $7.8 million this season).
Thats reportedly one of the reasons the Patriots were willing to deal him, because they have others who can do his job and they have so many players who need to be extended.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, are in the same boat.
The laundry list of scheduled free agents after this season is, right now, frighteningly long: Jones, Fitz, Floyd, Mathieu, Campbell, Rucker, Gresham, Minter, Ellington, Jefferson, Catanzaro and Fells, for starters.
But I am guessing there will be an extension or two the Cardinals will be trying to get done.
Jones was hospitalized in the postseason, reportedly after a bad reaction to synthetic marijuana (which, apparently, has no actual marijuana in it and is not illegal).
It was a mistake, but one source in New England said it was not reflective of who Jones is and shouldnt be an issue going forward.
The addition of Jones shouldnt rule out further pass rush help if the Cards find some in the draft or elsewhere.
It will be interesting to see if Dwight Freeney will remain in play, and what this could mean for Alex Okafor, who had been starting along with Markus Golden.
Coopers departure leaves a lot of unknowns on the offensive line.
Center is still a mystery.
With the possibility Ted Larsen could leave as a free agent, so is right guard.
The assumption is D.J.
Humphries can play right tackle, but that is no lock, especially with the news Andre Smith could still sign.
Earl Watford could have a big chance to win a starting job, and the Cards have been intrigued by Antoine McClain on the practice squad.
But there is still work to do to fill out the group next to Jared Veldheer and Mike Iupati.
UPDATE: This could change some things.
Ian Rapoport reports veteran guard Evan Mathis visited the Cardinals and he was offered a contract.
Rapoport also said veteran guard Geoff Schwartz is also supposed to visit the Cardinals.
The saga of Cooper is over.
He will not be playing center (Im not sure that was ever really a serious option, to be honest).
He will not be the guard, he will not be getting back to his pre-broken leg level, at least not with the Cardinals.
Three years into his career, questions still swirled around Coop.
He admitted after the season he struggled with criticism including from coaches which is tough in this business.
I will work on that because that is a major key to me improving is me being able to have my headspace correct, Cooper said.
Letting one or two mistakes snowball and keep me down, I cant let that happen anymore.
Even hearing negatively from outsiders, I cant let than bring me down.

Humphries, Dwight Freeney, Earl Watford, Evan Mathis, Geoff Schwartz, Jonathan Cooper, Markus Golden, Patriots Posted in | 73 Comments The case to keep Freeney Posted by on February 10, 2016 10:58 am There were so many reasons last year to think that a pairing of the Cardinals and veteran pass rusher Dwight Freeney made sense, long before it actually happened.
(The fact it took an injury to starter Alex Okafor to make it happen, and then to have Freeney perform as he did while Okafor somehow got hurt away from the team on playoff bye week, probably isnt lost on the Cardinals.) Freeney is a free agent.
At his age he turns 36 on Feb.
19 he made clear both during the season and after that he is in year-to-year mode.
He didnt know if he was going to try and play in 2016, and if he did, theres a question of whether the Cardinals will want to bring him back.
But ESPN did a list of 10 sleeper free agents, and of them Freeney is one.
The site notes Freeney had 36 pressures in just 264 snaps (and eight sacks, which is a pretty nice number for 264 snaps).
For a team that is still looking to upgrade its pass rush, having Freeney around certainly cannot hurt.
Would Freeney take another lower-salary deal with incentives like he signed this season?
Possible.
Freeney made it clear he doesnt want to play for a non-contender, so a) money cant be everything and b) he definitely likes being with the Cardinals and Bruce Arians.
He brings so much to the team besides QB pressures too; his ability to be a role model for younger rushers like Markus Golden is invaluable.
Freeney first has to decide if he wants to play again.
If he does, itll be interesting to see what money that season he just had can generate.
Its possible he could wait it out and be a just-before-camp guy for the Cardinals.
But Id think as they put together the roster, if they see Freeney as a key component, that signing would come much sooner.

No, not my kid.
(My boys were watching at University of Phoenix Stadium that day, in fact.) But I have a good friend who has covered the Packers for a long time.
And he had a daughter due to be born about a week after that Packers-Cardinals tilt.
A Green Bay win, and there was going to be some serious juggling to do in his life.
Cardinals cornerback Michael Adams unknowingly had my buddys back though, and Money Mikes strip-sack of Aaron Rodgers, leading to Dansbys return touchdown allowed no complications with job and family.
A few weeks later, I sent my friend a surprise gift.
It was a picture the one you see below signed by Adams, addressed to baby Madison: Madison Im glad I could make sure your Dad was there for you.
Michael Adams This is one of the first things I think of when I think of Cardinals-Packers in the playoffs in addition to Warner, and Money Mike and Dansby and Early Doucets helmet flying off and Fitzs diving touchdown and Rodgers being thisclose to hitting a wide-open Greg Jennings in overtime for what would have been a game-winning TD and made my friends life that much harder.
This game Saturday night, will it be as memorable?
If it puts the Cardinals in the NFC Championship, Im going to say yes.
I think the Cardinals can survive the loss of Alex Okafor.
Not sure yet how they make it happen I will be curious to see if they use DT Josh Mauro on the edge in run-down situations but I think theyll be OK.
They managed fine in run defense in the games Okafor missed (Steelers, Ravens, Browns) and against the pass, they should be good with Dwight Freeney and Markus Golden.
Saw this nugget from another Packer writer friend of mine, Wes Hodkiewicz: The Packers are 10-0 this year when hitting the QB at least five times.
On the flip side, you have the Cardinals offensive line, which has allowed only 27 sacks this season tied for fourth-fewest in the NFL.
Knock on wood, offensive coordinator/line coach Harold Goodwin said, chiding the reporter for bringing it up.
You cant do that to me.
Weve done a decent job all year of protection.
I dont know where were ranked or finished, as far as how many.
I really dont pay attention to that.
Weve just got to make sure weve got 11 guys on the same page, which is the biggest thing when it comes down to protection, and win the one-on-one battles up front.
Goodwin said the Cards lost two such battles early in the last Packers meeting.
They know as they have known all season protecting Carson Palmer is crucial.
That said, Palmer has been so fantastic this season with his footwork and moving in the pocket.
Hes not Rodgers or Russell Wilson, but hes better than Palmer 2013 or 2014 in that regard
